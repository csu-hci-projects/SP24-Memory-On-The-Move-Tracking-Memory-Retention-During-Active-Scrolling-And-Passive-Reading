## About:

Our daily lives are increasingly filled with digital interactions, from scrolling through social media feeds to reading news articles online. Given the rise of constant digital consumption, a key question emerges: how does it affect our ability to remember information? This study seeks to explore this pressing question. The research builds upon existing knowledge about memory and digital engagement. Our research employs a comparative analysis between active scrolling and passive reading tasks, incorporating a memory game designed to assess memory performance under different conditions, including visual cues variation.

## Pre-requisites:

Before running this project, ensure you have the following pre-requisites installed on your local machine:
 
1. **Python 3:** 
   - If you don't have Python 3 installed, you can download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
 
2. **pip:**
   - pip is a package manager for Python. It usually comes pre-installed with Python 3. However, if you don't have it, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
 
3. **pygame library:**
   - This project requires the pygame library. You can install it using the following pip command:
     ```
     pip install pygame
     ```
 
Once you have Python 3 and pip installed, and pygame library installed via pip, you're ready to run the project.

## Running the Game:
 
To compile and run the game, follow these steps:
 
1. **Navigate to the Game Directory:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and change directory to where the `MemoryGame.py` file is located.
 
2. **Run the Game:**
   - Once you're in the directory containing `MemoryGame.py`, use the following command to run the game:
     ```
     python MemoryGame.py
     ```
 
3. **Play the Game:**
   - The game will start running, and you can now enjoy playing it!
 
If you encounter any issues or errors during compilation or execution, please make sure you have followed the pre-requisites and installed the necessary dependencies mentioned in the README.

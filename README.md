**About:** 

Our daily lives are increasingly filled with digital interactions, from scrolling through social media feeds to reading news articles online. Given the rise of constant digital consumption, a key question emerges: how does it affect our ability to remember information? This study seeks to explore this pressing question. The research builds upon existing knowledge about memory and digital engagement. Our research employs a comparative analysis between active scrolling and passive reading tasks, incorporating a memory game designed to assess memory performance under different conditions, including visual cues variation.
